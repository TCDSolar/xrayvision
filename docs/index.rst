How the documentation is organized
==================================

Django has a lot of documentation. A high-level overview of how it's organized
will help you know where to look for certain things:

* :doc:`Tutorials </intro/index>` take you by the hand through a series of
  steps to create a Web application. Start here if you're new to Django or Web
  application development. Also look at the ":ref:`index-first-steps`" below.

* :doc:`Topic guides </topics/index>` discuss key topics and concepts at a
  fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.

* :doc:`Reference guides </ref/index>` contain technical reference for APIs and
  other aspects of Django's machinery. They describe how it works and how to
  use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.

* :doc:`How-to guides </howto/index>` are recipes. They guide you through the
  steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more
  advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Django works.

.. note:: The layout of this directory is simply a suggestion.  To follow
          traditional practice, do *not* edit this page, but instead place
          all documentation for the affiliated package inside ``xrayvision/``.
          The traditional practice was intended to allow the affiliated
          package to eventually be merged into the main astropy package.
          You can follow this practice or choose your own layout.
