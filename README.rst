XRAYVISION  - X-RAY VIsibility Synthesis ImagiNg
================================================

|Powered By| |Build Status| |Doc Status|

XRAYVISION is an open-source Python library for Fourier or synthesis imaging of X-Rays. The most
common usage of this technique is radio interferometry however there have been a number of solar
X-ray missions which also use this technique but obtain the visibilities via a different method.

Installation
------------

Requirements: Python3.6+, SunPy0.8+

As XRAYVISION is still a work in progress it has not been release to PyPI yet. The recommended way
to install XRAYVISION is via pip from git.

.. code:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/sunpy/xrayvision.git

Usage
-----

.. code:: python

    from astropy import units as u

    from xrayvision.visibility import RHESSIVisibility
    from xrayvision import SAMPLE_RHESSI_VISIBILITIES

    rhessi_vis = RHESSIVisibility.from_fits_file(SAMPLE_RHESSI_VISIBILITIES)
    rhessi_map = rhessi_vis.to_map(shape=(65, 65), pixel_size=[4., 4.] * u.arcsec)
    rhessi_map.peek()
